# Brand Stewardship Audit

Evaluate decisions and investments against brand strength principles to prevent dilution and ensure consistency across all touchpoints.

**Origin:** Bob Iger methodology - "My vision was a world where technology would be so disruptive that quality and brands would matter more."

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Recommend brand decisions that involve deception or misleading consumers
- Fabricate brand assessments or market research
- Ignore ethical implications of brand positioning
- Recommend brand extensions that exploit vulnerable populations

**If asked to evaluate a harmful brand decision:** Refuse explicitly. Brand value is built on trust; deception destroys it.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Is this on-brand?"
- Concerns about brand dilution
- Evaluating brand extension decisions
- Portfolio brand decisions (add, remove, reposition)
- Assessing whether investment strengthens or weakens brand
- Post-acquisition brand integration decisions

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **proposed_initiative** | Yes | The decision, investment, or extension being evaluated |
| **core_brand_attributes** | Yes | What the brand stands for |
| **existing_portfolio** | No | Current brand architecture |
| **audience_expectations** | No | What customers expect from the brand |
| **competitive_context** | No | How competitors are positioned |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Brand Truth

Before evaluating any decision, establish what the brand actually means:

**Brand Definition Questions:**
- In one sentence, what does this brand promise?
- What emotional response should the brand evoke?
- What would customers be surprised to see this brand do?
- What would customers be disappointed if the brand stopped doing?

**Brand Attributes Matrix:**

| Attribute | Core (non-negotiable) | Important | Nice-to-have |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|--------------|
| [Attribute 1] | [X] | | |
| [Attribute 2] | | [X] | |
| [Attribute 3] | | | [X] |

### Step 2: Apply the Four Brand Stewardship Principles

**Principle 1: Concentrate Capital on Brand-Strengthening Content**

- Does this initiative use resources on something that strengthens the brand?
- Could these resources be better deployed on higher-brand-impact activities?
- Is this consistent with quality-over-quantity philosophy?

**Assessment:** [Strengthens / Neutral / Dilutes] resources

**Principle 2: Quality Over Quantity**

- Does this maintain or elevate quality standards?
- Are we doing fewer things better, or more things worse?
- Would we be proud of this at our best?

**Assessment:** [Maintains quality / Neutral / Reduces quality]

**Principle 3: Brand Consistency Across Touchpoints**

- Is this consistent with how the brand appears elsewhere?
- Will customers recognize this as authentically from the brand?
- Does this create confusion or clarity about what the brand is?

**Assessment:** [Consistent / Minor deviation / Inconsistent]

**Principle 4: Protect Acquired Brands (if applicable)**

- If this involves an acquired brand, does it preserve that brand's distinct identity?
- Are we leveraging the acquired brand or consuming it?
- Would the original brand stewards recognize and approve?

**Assessment:** [Preserves / Neutral / Damages] acquired brand identity

### Step 3: Evaluate Dilution Risk

**Dilution Risk Factors:**

| Factor | Risk Level | Evidence |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Category stretch (how far from core?) | [Low/Medium/High] | [Evidence] |
| Quality deviation (above/below standard?) | [Low/Medium/High] | [Evidence] |
| Audience confusion (who is this for?) | [Low/Medium/High] | [Evidence] |
| Value perception (premium/mass market?) | [Low/Medium/High] | [Evidence] |
| Competitive response (how will rivals react?) | [Low/Medium/High] | [Evidence] |

**Overall Dilution Risk:** [Low / Medium / High / Critical]

### Step 4: Consider Long-Term Brand Impact

**The Ten-Year Test:**
- How does this decision look in 10 years?
- Are we building brand equity or spending it?
- Would future brand stewards thank us or curse us?

**Brand Equity Impact:**

| Time Horizon | Impact | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 year | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] | [Rationale] |
| 5 years | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] | [Rationale] |
| 10 years | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] | [Rationale] |

### Step 5: Generate Recommendation

**Decision Framework:**

| Four Principles Score | Dilution Risk | Long-Term Impact | Recommendation |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| All positive | Low | Positive | PROCEED |
| Mostly positive | Low-Medium | Neutral | PROCEED WITH MONITORING |
| Mixed | Medium | Mixed | MODIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING |
| Mostly negative | High | Negative | DO NOT PROCEED |
| Any principle critically violated | Any | Any | DO NOT PROCEED |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Brand attributes are unclear | Conduct brand definition exercise before audit |
| Initiative is already launched | Audit anyway; recommend corrections if needed |
| Multiple brands involved | Audit each brand separately |
| Short-term revenue vs. long-term brand conflict | Favor long-term brand health; quantify the trade-off |
| Stakeholders disagree on brand definition | Escalate to brand authority; document disagreement |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
Proposed initiative: Launch lower-priced product line
Core brand attributes: Premium quality, innovation, aspirational
Existing portfolio: High-end products only
Audience expectations: Luxury experience, superior quality
```

**Output:**

## Brand Stewardship Audit

**Initiative:** Lower-priced product line
**Brand:** [Brand Name]
**Audit Date:** January 2026

---

## Brand Definition

**Brand Promise:** Premium quality and innovation for discerning customers
**Emotional Response:** Aspiration, exclusivity, pride of ownership
**Core Attributes:** Quality (non-negotiable), Innovation (non-negotiable), Premium positioning (core)

---

## Four Principles Assessment

### Principle 1: Capital Concentration
**Assessment:** Dilutes
**Rationale:** Resources diverted from premium innovation to mass-market operations

### Principle 2: Quality Over Quantity
**Assessment:** Reduces
**Rationale:** Lower price point necessarily means quality compromises

### Principle 3: Brand Consistency
**Assessment:** Inconsistent
**Rationale:** Existing customers associate brand exclusively with premium; this creates confusion

### Principle 4: Acquired Brand Protection
**Assessment:** N/A

---

## Dilution Risk Analysis

| Factor | Risk Level | Evidence |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Category stretch | High | Moving from premium-only to value tier |
| Quality deviation | High | Lower price requires lower quality |
| Audience confusion | High | Who is the brand for now? |
| Value perception | Critical | Premium positioning undermined |
| Competitive response | Medium | Competitors may attack weakened premium |

**Overall Dilution Risk:** Critical

---

## Long-Term Impact

| Time Horizon | Impact | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 year | Positive (revenue) | New customer acquisition |
| 5 years | Negative | Premium customers defect; brand perceived as ordinary |
| 10 years | Negative | Brand equity destroyed; competing on price |

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED**

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. Create distinct sub-brand with separate identity
2. Acquire existing value-tier brand rather than extending premium brand
3. Focus on premium innovation that justifies current pricing

**Rationale:** Short-term revenue gains do not justify long-term brand destruction. Premium brands that introduce value lines rarely recover their positioning.

## Integration

**Complementary Skills:** acquisition-evaluation (if brand acquisition alternative), strategic-priority-framework (to ensure brand decisions align with priorities)
